thought process outlined below:

1. to use BOW we can just use the vectorize function from sklearn and then we can vectorize all of the words

2. I will keep all of the common words since their frequency can give us a hint to how simple the passage is.

3. very unique words will still be filtered out since they will not be generalizable anyways.
